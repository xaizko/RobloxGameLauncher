This folder is unnecessary, it is meant to be a QOL thing.  
You can remove it if you want but be careful where you place your icons.  
I'm not sure if deleting an icon from your computer will also delete it from the shortcut  
When I tested it, my shortcut's icon wasn't removed but that could have just been a delay thing.
