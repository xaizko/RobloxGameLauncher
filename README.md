# Roblox Game Launcher üéÆüöÄ

## Icon Tips üñºÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏èüîò
- Want a custom icon for your shortcut? Use a .ico file.
- If you only have PNG or JPEG images, convert them to .ico using any free online converter:
  - Search the web for "PNG to ICO" or "JPEG to ICO" ‚Äî choose a reputable converter.
  - Convert and download the .ico file, then pass its path to the script (e.g., -Icon "C:\icons\mygame.ico").
  - You can simply get the path by right clicking on the icon and then press copy as path.
  - It is recommend you place the icon inside of the provided icons folder so that you don't accidentally delete it.

## Troubleshooting ‚ùó
- Shortcut doesn't launch the game:
  - Make sure Roblox is installed for the current user and can launch games normally.
  - Verify you used the correct Game ID (place/universe id).
- Icon doesn't show / is blank:
  - Confirm the .ico file is valid and accessible.
  - Windows may cache icons ‚Äî try restarting Explorer or clearing icon cache.
